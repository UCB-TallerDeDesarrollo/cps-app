            question: "Why are challenging kids challenging?",
            answer: "Because they’re lacking the skills not to be challenging. If they had the skills, they wouldn’t be challenging. That’s because –and this is perhaps the key theme of the model – Kids do well if they can. And because (here’s another key theme) Doing well is preferable to not doing well. This, of course, is a dramatic departure from the view of challenging kids as attention-seeking, manipulative, coercive, limit-testing, and poorly motivated. It’s a completely di erent set of lenses, supported by research in the neurosciences over the past 30-40 years, and it has dramatic implications for how caregivers go about helping such kids."
        }, {
            question: "When are challenging kids challenging?",
            answer: "When the demands or expectations being placed upon them exceed the skills that they have to respond adaptively. Of course, that’s when we all respond maladaptively: when we’re lacking the skills to respond adaptively. Thus, an important goal for helpers is to identify the skills a challenging kid is lacking. An even more important goal is to identify the speci c expectations a kid is having di culty meeting, referred to as unsolved problems... and to help kids solve those problems. Because unsolved problems tend to be highly predictable, the problem-solving should be proactive most of the time. Identifying lagging skills and unsolved problems is accomplished through use of an instrument called the Assessment of Lagging Skills and Unsolved Problems (ALSUP). You can  nd the ALSUP in The Paperwork section of the website of Lives in the Balance, the nonpro t Dr. Greene founded to help disseminate his approach (livesinthebalance.org)."
        }, {
            question: "What behaviors do challenging kids exhibit when they don’t have the skills to respond adaptively to certain demands?",
            answer: "Challenging kids communicate that they’re struggling to meet demands and expectations in some fairly common ways: whining, pouting, sulking, withdrawing, crying, screaming, swearing, hitting, spitting, kicking, throwing, lying, stealing, and so forth. But what a kid does when he’s having trouble meeting demands and expectations isn’t the most important part (though it may feel that way). Why and when he’s doing these things are much more important."
        }, {
            question: "What should we be doing di erently to help these kids better than we’re helping them now?",
            answer: "If challenging behavior is set in motion by lagging skills and not lagging motivation, then it’s easy to understand why rewarding and punishing a kid may not make things better. Since challenging behavior occurs in response to highly predictable unsolved problems, then the goal is to solve those problems. But if we solve them unilaterally, through imposition of adult will (referred to in the model as “Plan A”), then we’ll only increase the likelihood of challenging episodes and we won’t solve any problems durably. Better to solve those problems collaboratively (“Plan B”) so the kid is a fully invested participant, solutions are more durable, and (over time) the kid -- and often the adults as well -- learn the skills they were lacking all along. Plan B is comprised of three basic ingredients. The  rst ingredient – called the Empathy step – involves gathering information from the child so as to achieve the clearest understanding of his or her concern or perspective on a given unsolved problem. The second ingredient (called the De ne Adult Concerns step) involves entering into consideration the adult concern or perspective on the same unsolved problem. The third ingredient (called the Invitation step) involves having the adult and kid brainstorm solutions so as to arrive at a plan of action that is both realistic and mutually satisfactory...in other words, a solution that addresses the concerns of both parties and that both parties can actually perform."

            question: "Isn't this the same model as what was previously known as Collaborative Problem Solving?",
            answer: "Dr. Greene is the originator of the Collaborative Problem Solving approach, and for many years referred to his model by that name in his research papers, scholarly articles, books, and workshops. He now calls his model Collaborative & Proactive Solutions (CPS). Be careful! There are others using the name Collaborative Problem Solving out there, but they had nothing to do with the origination or development of CPS Model and are not associated with Dr. Greene or Lives in the Balance in any way!"

            question: "A major premise of Dr. Greene's approach is that challenging behavior is a form of developmental delay. What research supports this idea?",
            answer: "Much of the research is, for better or worse (mostly worse) tied to specific diagnoses, but the link between lagging skills and challenging behavior is unequivocal.  For example, the association between ADHD and lagging executive skills (e.g., difficulty shifting cognitive set, doing things in a logical sequence, having a sense of time, maintaining focus, controlling one’s impulses) is well-established.  Equally well-established is the fact that kids with ADHD are at subsequent increased risk for other diagnoses (and much more serious challenging behavior), such as oppositional defiant disorder (temper outbursts, arguing with adults, and defiance) and conduct disorder (bullying, threatening, intimidating, fighting, physical aggression, stealing, destroying property, lying, truancy). There are also convincing data documenting increased rates of oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) and conduct disorder (CD) in kids with mood disorders (i.e.. those who have difficulty with skills related to the regulating of one’s emotions, including managing one’s emotional response to frustration so as to think rationally [separation of affect]), and in kids who are socially impaired (including skills such as accurately interpreting social cues, seeking attention in appropriate ways, appreciating how one’s behavior is affecting others, empathizing, and appreciating how one is being perceived by others).  The research literature has increasingly shown that kids with language processing delays (including skills such as considering a range of solutions to a problem; expressing concerns, needs, or thoughts in words; and understanding what is being said) are at significantly greater risk for ODD and CD as well. And there is a persuasive and growing literature documenting the very challenging behaviors that can accompany autism spectrum disorders and non-verbal learning disability (and the black-and-white, concrete, literal thinking that typifies these disorders). We’ve learned a lot about children’s brains in the last 30 years.  We now know how challenging kids come to be challenging. It’s time for our actions to reflect our knowledge."
        }, {
            question: "In Lost at School, you point out that kids with behavioral challenges aren’t usually challenging every second of every waking hour. Some kids are challenging at home and not at school, others at school and not at home, and others in both places. If it’s true that the kid is lacking skills, then why would he be lacking them in one place and not another? Isn’t the discrepancy in behavior between home and school proof that he’s choosing to behave one way in one place and another way in the other? Isn’t that a sign that the kid is doing well only when he wants to?",
            answer: "Actually, it’s proof that challenging behavior is specific to certain conditions. Under what conditions does challenging behavior occur?  Those where skills are being required of the kid that he does not yet sufficiently possess or where problems arise that he hasn’t been able to solve.  But precisely where and when those conditions are present differs from kid to kid. Especially in cases where a kid is more challenging at home than school, it’s common for people to explain the disparity as the result of poor parenting.  That’s usually not true.  The school environment may have advantages that reduce the likelihood of challenging behavior in some kids.  School environments tend to be more structured and predictable than home environments, and this can reduce the likelihood of challenging behavior in some (but by no means all) challenging kids.  Often medicines that are helpful for reducing challenging behavior at school have worn off by the time the kid arrives at home.  And some kids are able to stay tightly wrapped during the school day and then completely unravel – some would say decompensate – the minute they’re back at home.  Of course, most of us look a lot better when we’re outside the home than when we’re inside it! Even when the reverse is true – if a kid’s challenges are greater at school than at home – it’s not uncommon for the finger to be pointed at parents (“Sure, the parents just let him do what he wants at home.  No wonder he doesn’t act up with them.”).  The more plausible and productive explanation is that the school is placing demands on the kid – for focused learning, organizing, sustained effort, and getting along with others – that may not be nearly as intense at home. This presents another opportunity for adults to stop pointing and start identifying lagging skills and unsolved problems."
        }, {
            question: "In Lost at School, you say that this model doesn’t require that adults suspend all of their expectations so a kid won’t exhibit challenging behavior. Care to say more about that?",
            answer: "Sure thing. It would be impossible to teach, parent, or help kids without having expectations.  CPS Model does not involve dropping all expectations. But since you can’t fix everything at once, it makes sense to eliminate some low priority expectations (in other words, use Plan C) so the kid is more “available” to work on the higher priority expectations and problems that remain.  Just because you’re eliminating a given expectation now doesn’t mean you won’t come back to it once some higher priority expectations have been met. You will want to consider whether your expectations for each kid are truly realistic, and grade level and chronological age typically are not great indicators of a kid’s developmental readiness for a particular expectation.  We often place expectations on kids that we know they can’t meet, and then punish them when they handle our expectations as poorly as we suspected they would.  An unrealistic expectation is a challenging behavior waiting to happen."
        }, {
            question: "Do you believe in holding kids accountable for their actions?",
            answer: "It depends on what you mean by “accountable.”  For some folks, holding a kid accountable for his actions simply means making sure he pays the price for his challenging behavior.  In the Dr. Greene&#8217;s model, holding a kid accountable means that the kid is participating in a process in which he’s identifying and articulating his own concerns or perspectives, taking yours into account, and working toward a realistic and mutually satisfactory solution.  One could make the case that Plan B is actually more effective at holding a kid accountable than Plan A, since the kid is participating in and actually thinking about a plan to reduce his challenging behavior (and taking your concerns into account) rather than merely being on the receiving end of imposed adult will and endless adult ingenuity."
        }, {
            question: "Shouldn’t I still be using consequences for challenging behavior – even if I don’t think they’re working – so the other kids know I’m taking the challenging behavior seriously?",
            answer: "It’s your choice, but you don’t need to use consequences for the other kids to notice that you’re taking the problem seriously.  They need to see that you’ve got a handle on the challenging kid’s lagging skills and unsolved problems and that, slowly but surely, his challenging behaviors are decreasing.  You don’t improve your credibility by continuing to intervene in a way that isn’t working or is making things worse.  Consequences are useful for two things:  (1) teaching basic lessons about right and wrong and (2) giving kids the incentive to do well.  You’ll want to use consequences if you think one or both of these things are coming into play.  But kids with behavioral challenges already know the basic lessons about right and wrong and, because kids do well if they can, they already have the incentive to do well."
        }, {
            question: "Is it really fair to expect teachers – who are not trained as mental health professionals – to solve problems collaboratively?",
            answer: "I don’t know what’s fair. I do know that teachers already have a lot on their plates.  I know that an astounding number of challenging kids are needlessly slipping through the cracks and losing their futures.  And I know that a mental health degree is not a prerequisite for solving problems collaboratively. Teachers have always taught non-academic skills to their students, skills related to handling life’s social, emotional, and behavioral challenges.  It’s just that some kids and some challenges require that teachers have a different mind-set and skill-set.  What are the key qualifications for helping kids with behavioral challenges?  An open mind, a willingness to reflect on one’s current practices and try on new lenses, the courage to experiment with new practices, and the patience and resolve to become comfortable assessing lagging skills and unsolved problems and using Plan B.  If it makes you feel any better, most mental health professionals don’t have training in solving problems collaboratively either."

            question: "It seems like you think teachers should be all things to all kids.",

        }, {
            question: "Aren’t there some challenging kids who need meds?",
            answer: "Yes, though nowhere near as many as are actually on meds.  The over-medicating of kids flows from an over-emphasis on diagnoses, the ease with which medications are prescribed, a lack of awareness of the true factors underlying kids’ challenging behavior, the failure to achieve a comprehensive understanding of a kid’s challenges, and a lack of knowledge of Plan B.  That said, there are some kids for whom psychotropic medication is an indispensable component of treatment and whose participation in Plan B is impossible without medication.  It’s crucial to differentiate between the things psychotropic medicine does well and the things psychotropic medicine does not do well lest, as is commonly the case, medicine be prescribed for things medicine does not do well.  Medicine is effective at reducing hyperactivity and poor impulse control; improving attention span; enhancing mood; reducing obsessive-compulsive behaviors and general anxiety; reducing tics; inducing sleep; and helping volatile, aggressive kids be less reactive.  Medicine does not teach skills.  Medicine does not help kids solve problems.  But it can help kids be more “available” to learn skills and solve problems."
        }, {
            question: "In the research literature, training cognitive skills to kids with challenging behavior often hasn’t fared very well. How is this model different?",
            answer: "In the research literature (and in real life) cognitive skills training has often been conducted outside the environments in which a kid is having the greatest difficulty and by people the kid isn’t having difficulty with; for example, in the office of a guidance counselor, principal, or mental health professional; or in a researcher’s lab.  Skills taught in these artificial environments often haven’t generalized to the environments in which the kid was having difficulty.  In addition, the training has been done in a rote, circumscribed fashion using skills-training modules or curriculum that were not tailored to the specific lagging skills or unsolved problems of individual kids."
        }, {
            question: "Does this model help with kids on the autism spectrum?",
            answer: "It’s often assumed that this model has no application to these kids, and that well-known applied behavior analysis methodology is really the only option. I beg to differ. “Autism spectrum” doesn’t say anything about the kid’s general cognitive functioning, and unless you’re ready to throw in the towel on teaching the kid lagging skills or helping him learn to solve problems – and hopefully, you’re not – then this model may well have a role to play. The most common obstacle is linguistic skills. As described above, you’ll want to focus first on helping the kid develop the skills to communicate his concerns (often through pictures or hand signals) in a very rudimentary manner. Then, if possible, you’ll want to focus (if it’s feasible) on helping the kid express these same concerns verbally. Along the way, you’ll be watching closely to see if there is some mechanism for the kid to participate in generating solutions."
        }, {
            question: "How does this model differ from other crisis management programs?",
            answer: "While this model can help defuse a crisis, it’s not primarily a crisis management program. It’s a crisis prevention program. In other words, it’s good to know how to defuse and de-escalate during a crisis, but it’s far better to know how to prevent crises from occurring in the first place. No other learning disability is handled in crisis mode, and a crisis is clearly not the best time to address the lagging skills and unsolved problems underlying social, emotional, and behavioral challenges."
        }, {
            question: "How do poverty and culture impact the effectiveness of CPS Model?",
            answer: "At the risk of seeming insensitive, I think poverty is over-rated as an explanation for challenging behavior in kids (in his seminal book, Schools Without Failure, Dr. William Glasser agreed). There are kids from impoverished circumstances who succeed. There are kids from wealthy backgrounds who don’t. Those who come from wealth often have parents who will stop at nothing to access good care and have the resources and wherewithal to find and pay for it. Some receive very poor care anyway. Data suggest that socioeconomic status is not a predictor of success with the model. I do think that people from similar backgrounds sometimes have an easier time connecting with and communicating with each other. But I’ve yet to run into an ethnic group whose members don’t value having their concerns heard and addressed. In fact, look any place in the world where there’s conflict right now and you’ll see one people whose concerns are being disregarded and another imposing its will. It’s very reliable."
        }, {
            question: "Does the this model apply to kids who shoot people in our schools?",
            answer: "Kids who act on the idea of shooting people at school are clearly having difficulty coming up with more adaptive solutions to problems they’ve been unable to solve. In many instances where kids have resorted to extreme violence, people were surprised that the kid went to such extremes. But we all have what might be called a “threshold of adversity,” and we all have different levels of skill in dealing with adversity. When a person’s threshold of adversity exceeds their skills, the likelihood of violence is heightened. That’s why it’s crucial to keep the lines of communication open with every kid so you’re aware of his lagging skills and unsolved problems. Create a helping relationship. Work collaboratively toward solving the problems so the kid learns the skills."

            question: "Isn’t this model really just a sophisticated form of battle picking?",
            answer: "Not at all. Prior to learning about Plan B, many adults thought they had only two options:  impose their will or drop their expectations.  If those are your only options, then picking your battles is precisely what you’re doing.  Plan B isn’t a choice between battling and not battling.  It’s about getting concerns identified and addressed, solving problems, teaching skills, reducing challenging behavior, and forming a helping relationship."
        }, {
            question: "Does this model mean there’s no such thing as setting limits anymore?",
            answer: "Setting limits” means an adult has a concern they want to ensure is addressed.  With Plan A, adults are making sure that their concerns are addressed (through imposition of adult will) but are disregarding kids’ concerns.  As you’ve read, there are significant drawbacks to this approach to setting limits because, as noted above, Plan A teaches no skills, solves no problems durably, and, in challenging kids, heightens the likelihood of challenging behavior.  Even in “ordinary” kids, Plan A is an application of “might makes right.”  Isn’t “might makes right” the wrong turn society took a long time ago?  If there’s another way to have kids meet adult expectations without teaching them that might makes right, shouldn’t we be interested?  With Plan B, adults are making sure that their concerns are addressed – the adults are setting limits -- but are also committed to ensuring that kids’ concerns are addressed.  So long as the concerns of one party go unaddressed, the problem is not durably solved.  But you’re setting limits whether you’re using Plan A or Plan B."

            question: "You’ve written that simply communicating an expectation to a kid is not the same thing as using Plan A.  Can you explain that further?",
            answer: "You’re not using any Plan when you’re communicating or reminding a kid of an expectation.  The three Plans represent your options for dealing with unmet expectations.  That said, there’s definitely such a thing as “style points” in how adults go about communicating or reminding a kid of their expectations.  In other words, it’s possible to communicate expectations in a way that will send some of the more reactive kids right over the edge."

        }, {
            question: "So Plan B doesn’t undermine a teacher’s authority with the other kids in the class?",
            answer: "Quite the contrary.  The other kids are watching closely.  If you intervene in a way that solves problems, teaches skills, and reduces challenging behavior, you’ll have done nothing to undermine your authority with the other kids.  In fact, don’t be surprised if they start asking if you’d mind addressing their problems in the same way."

        }, {
            question: "It’s a Plan A world.  If we’re doing Plan B with a kid, aren’t we setting him up for failure?",
            answer: "First off, don’t be so sure it’s a Plan A world.  In fact, it’s worth pondering which skills are most important for life in the “real world”:  the blind adherence to authority trained with Plan A, or working things out with people in a realistic and mutually satisfactory manner trained with Plan B.  I think it’s the latter.   Second, the reason you’re doing Plan B is so you can teach the kid the skills he lacks, as you would with any other developmental delay.  The reason you’re using Plan B now is so the kid doesn’t need Plan B for the rest of his life."

        }, {
            question: "For how long do the adults need to do Plan B with a kid?",
            answer: "Certainly until the high priority lagging skills are trained, the most important unsolved problems are resolved, and the kid’s challenging behavior has been dramatically reduced.  But there are many good reasons to keep using Plan B, not just with a specific challenging kid but with everyone in the class."

        }, {
            question: "What if the kid doesn’t follow through on his part of the solution?",
            answer: "This is usually a sign that the original solution wasn’t as realistic and mutually satisfactory as you may have thought.  By the way, kids are not the only ones who sometimes have trouble following through on solutions they’ve agreed to. Either way, you’re back to the Plan B drawing board.  If it makes you feel any better, in life most good solutions follow solutions that didn’t pan out so well. The important thing is to learn from the solutions that didn’t get the job done."

            question: "What if the kid says he doesn’t care about your concern?",
            answer: "He gets 10 points for honesty.  Sounds like a kid who’s had a lot of his own concerns blown off the table and is now responding in kind.  Plan A begets Plan A Plan B begets Plan B. The long-term answer to a kid not caring about your concerns is to care more about his.  The short-term answer is to acknowledge that he doesn’t care about your concern, that there’s really no way for you to make him care about your concerns, to let him know that you’ve begun trying very hard to take his concerns into account (hopefully, he’s noticed), to point out that your goal is to find a solution that addresses his concerns and yours, and to underscore the fact that once the problem is solved it won’t get in the way anymore."

            question: "Don’t adults’ concerns trump kids’ concerns?",
            answer: "If the adult’s concerns are trumping the kid’s concerns, then you’re not doing Plan B, you’re doing Plan A.  Even if the adult’s concern is really important, there’s no reason to dismiss the kid’s concern or to think that both concerns can’t be addressed using Plan B. "
        }, {
            question: "Don’t adult solutions trump kids’ solutions?",
            answer: "Not if you want to solve a problem durably, meaning in a realistic and mutually satisfactory manner.  If a kid isn’t OK with a solution, or if it doesn’t address his concerns, the problem is not durably solved and will resurface."

The only problem is, I don’t know if it’s truly realistic for us to assume that you’ll be able to stay in your seat all the time.  Let’s see if we can come up with a solution that you can really do.”  Or, “Well, that’s an option.  They only thing is, if I let you walk around the room whenever you feel like it, your concern would be addressed -- you know, that it’s hard for you to sit in your seat for long periods of time -- but my concern that I don’t want you to disturb your classmates wouldn’t be addressed.  Let’s see if we can come up with a solution that works for both of us.” "

            question: "I understand the necessity of making sure that a challenging kid has the skills to participate in Plan B.  But there are some kids who just won’t talk to me, even though I think they have the skills to do it.",
            answer: "While Plan B can run aground for many reasons, adults often comment that they “never got past the Empathy step,” often because “the kid didn’t have a concern” or because “he denied there was a problem” or because “the kid wouldn’t talk.”  As you now know, there are a variety of factors that can interfere with a kid talking.  But hopefully you’re reasonably certain that you didn’t use Plan A (in many kids, Plan A is a very effective conversation-stopper), that your Empathy step wasn’t perfunctory (some kids clam up instantaneously when adults come to erroneous conclusions about their concerns), that your timing was good (Emergency B is generally not the ideal way to help reluctant talkers talk), that you used the steps in the proper order (are you sure you didn’t start Plan B with your concern?), and that the kid has the skills to participate in Plan B.  What else would make it hard for a kid to talk?  While many kids will begin talking simply because you’re not using Plan A, some don’t.  While many start talking again because someone is finally trying to understand their concerns, some won’t.  Some kids lost faith and trust in adults a long time ago.  Some don’t know what it’s like to have an adult try to help in ways that aren’t punitive.  Some are so accustomed to having their concerns dismissed that they’ve just stopped talking.  Some are now used to viewing adults as “the enemy.”  So you have your work cut out for you.<br><br>Some adults have an easier time forging relationships with challenging kids and drawing them out. They have a natural feel for how to approach these kids, are good at connecting with them about things that aren’t related to school, and often use humor to help them feel more comfortable.  But that doesn’t mean that those who are less “natural” can’t grow better at it."

            question: "I couldn’t get past the Empathy step because the kid kept saying “I don’t know” when I inquired about his concerns. Suggestions?",
            answer: "You’ll need to figure out what kind of an “I don’t know” it is.  “I don’t know” can mean a lot of different things, and the meaning of a kid’s “I don’t know” will, of course, determine your response.  It’s possible he really doesn’t know what his concern is about the problem you’re trying to discuss.  It’s possible you’ve never inquired in this manner before, so it’s also possible he’s never given the matter any thought.  Proactive Plan B provides him with the opportunity to give the matter some thought.  That is, if you’re able to give him the chance.  A lot of adults aren’t comfortable with the silence that can occur as a kid is thinking about his concern.  Remember, if you’re busy talking while the kid is trying to think, you’ll greatly reduce your chances of gathering information about your kid’s concern, and thereby greatly reduce the likelihood that his concern will be addressed.<br><br>If, after you’ve given your kid the chance to think, you become convinced that he really has no idea what his concern is on the unsolved problem you’ve raised, your best option is educated guessing, or what might be called hypothesis testing.  Suggest a few possibilities, based on past experience, and see if any resonate.  The good news is that, for each problem, there are finite possibilities.  In other words, while it might feel like there is a universe of possible concerns interfering, for example, with your kid completing his homework, there are probably only four or five.  Same number (though different possibilities) for most of the other problems you and your kid are trying to solve together.<br><br>What else could “I don’t know” mean?  It could mean that the kid forgot or didn’t understand what you asked and, if he doesn’t verbalize one of those things, his facial expression would likely provide some hints.  Of course, you could always inquire:  “Do you remember my question?” or “Do you understand what I’m asking?”  Repeat or clarify the question if necessary.  “I don’t know” can also be a sign that a kid doesn’t feel comfortable telling you his concern.  He may be accustomed to having his concerns blown off the table so he doesn’t see the point in expressing them anymore.  He may be concerned that if he’s honest you’ll get mad.  So he may need some reassurance from you along these lines.  I often clarify this by asking kids the following question:  “Do you not know what your concern is, or do you know but are having difficulty finding the words to say?”  If the kid doesn’t have the words, at least he has you to help out."

            question: "I was doing Plan B with a kid in my class and things seemed to be going well for a few weeks but then deteriorated again.  What happened?",
            answer: "It could be that the solution you and the kid agreed on wasn’t as realistic and mutually satisfactory as it originally seemed.  That’s a fairly common occurrence, and it means that there is some additional problem-solving to do.  It could also be that your initial success was due more to the quick burst of relationship-enhancing that occurs with Plan B.  Durably solving problems takes longer, and teaching skills longer still.  Unfortunately, it’s when initial Plan B solutions fail to stand the test of time that adults are most prone to discard their improved relationship with a challenging kid and head back to the Plan A hills.   Don’t forget, Plan A wasn’t working very well for a very long time.  The ingredients Plan B brings to interacting with and helping kids are reliable but not magical.<br><br>In fact, once people start using the model with a kid, they discover that there’s an impressive, perhaps overwhelming, pile of accumulated problems that have been precipitating challenging behavior for a long time.  Remember, you won’t be able to solve them all at once.  Work toward solutions for one or two problems at a time, then move on to other problems once those initial problems are solved, all the while watching for whether the solutions to the initial problems are standing the test of time.  After a while, you’ll have made quite a dent in the pile and the kid will have the beginnings of some new skills.  Keep returning to the pile as necessary."

            question: "Are there kids Plan B won’t help?  Who need to be placed in programs outside of public schools?",
            answer: "There are kids who might, despite our best efforts, need to be placed in such programs.  But it would be interesting to see how the numbers of those kids would change if more schools were incorporating the model into their practices for assessing and addressing the needs of kids with behavioral challenges (studies examining this question are currently in progress).  In several current projects, researchers are examining the degree to which implementation of the  model reduces not only challenging behavior but also special ed costs and referrals, the use of suspension, detention, and expulsion, and placement in programs outside of their home schools."

            question: "Doesn’t helping kids with behavioral challenges take a lot of time?",
            answer: "Yes, helping – especially the kind that involves teaching skills and solving problems durably – does take time.  But perpetually dealing with kids’ challenges in ways that aren’t working takes more.  And don’t forget, Proactive Plan B is taking place at opportune moments, not under emergent conditions."

            question: "I’m a classroom teacher, I have 25 kids in my class, I’m the only one in there, and I have a bunch of kids in who are on special education programs and need my attention. When am I going to do Plan B?",
            answer: "Most teachers find that Plan B can be done during the times they’re devoting individual attention to other student problems (for instance, academic challenges), such as before school, after school, during recess, or during lunch; whenever there’s an opportunity to take five or ten minutes to help a kid.  I’ve also found that principals and assistant principals are usually happy to find coverage so you can devote additional time to a challenging student.  You’ll probably want to direct your initial Plan B efforts at the kids whose challenges are most severe and who are disrupting the classroom process the most.  Then move on to the rest of the kids who need Plan B.  You’re probably devoting a lot of time to the kids with behavioral challenges already.  While Plan B takes a little extra time and planning up front, my experience is that it dramatically reduces the amount of time you’re spending on challenging behavior overall."

            question: "Are there some challenging kids who are so volatile and unstable that academics need to be de-emphasized until things are calmer?",
            answer: "Absolutely.  Some kids simply aren’t “available” for academic learning until headway has been made on the challenges that may be impeding learning.  In such instances, academics may have to take a back-seat until progress occurs on these challenges.  Plunging forward with academics when a kid is bogged down in behavioral challenges is usually an exercise in futility."

            question: "Is this model truly realistic in a middle, junior, or senior high school, where kids have multiple teachers who don’t always have a chance to communicate with each other?",
            answer: "Many middle and high schools are organized in teams or learning communities these days, so that should make things a bit easier.  Nothing takes the place of ensuring that staff has the time to talk about high priority kids and meet periodically (preferably, at least weekly) to monitor the kids’ progress. Again, the only models of care that don’t require good communication are the ineffective ones.  This model isn’t the answer to all the communication and scheduling problems that plague some middle, junior, and senior high schools, but it can help address communication problems in two ways:  First, by providing staff with a framework for organizing and communicating information about a challenging kid.  Second, Plan B provides staff with the elements and processes they’ll need to tackle and solve their remaining communication problems."

            question: "If I’m working within a teaching team, how do we determine which of us should be doing Plan B with a given student on a particular problem?",
            answer: "Early on, it will probably be whoever volunteers!  But if you have several willing collaborators, you might want to give thought to who has the best relationship with the student, who he’s already talking to, and, if the problem is related to interactions with one member of the team, whether it would be better for that member to approach the kid or potentially more productive for him to talk about it with a different member."

            question: "If it’s lagging cognitive skills and unsolved problems that set the stage for social, emotional, and behavioral challenges in kids, what is the fate of the functional behavior assessment (FBA) routinely done in schools to better understand challenging behavior?",
            answer: "For the unfamiliar, a functional assessment (sometimes called a functional analysis) is a procedure through which the function (causes, purposes, goals) of a kid’s challenging behavior is identified.  Though FBAs are common in schools, the information gathered through and inferences drawn from a functional analysis vary depending on the orientation, training, and experience of the evaluator conducting the procedure. A core assumption guiding most FBAs is that maladaptive behavior is “working” for a kid by allowing him to “get” something desirable (e.g., attention, peer approval) or “escape” or “avoid” something undesirable (e.g., a difficult, tedious, unpleasant task).  The belief that challenging behaviors are somehow “working” for a kid leads many adults to the conclusion that those behaviors are purposeful -- what might be referred to as the intentionality attributional bias -- and this can set the stage for misguided statements such as, “It must be working for him or he wouldn’t be doing it.”  This mentality invariably sets the stage for interventions aimed at punishing kids’ challenging behaviors so the behaviors don’t “work” anymore, and rewarding adaptive replacement behaviors to encourage ones that “work” better.  This is the foundation of most school discipline programs. But this definition of “function” reflects what I call the “first pass” of a functional assessment.  There’s an indispensable “second pass” – a deeper level of analysis – that, regrettably, often goes neglected:  What lagging skills account for why the kid is getting, avoiding, and escaping in such a maladaptive fashion?   This question springs from the core mentality of the model (Kids do well if they can) and from the assumption that if a kid could get, escape, or avoid in an adaptive fashion – in a way that “worked” without causing all the misery that accompanies his challenging behavior – he surely would.  When one is focused on the “second pass” of a functional assessment, it becomes clear that the essential function of challenging behavior is to communicate to adults that a kid doesn’t possess the skills to handle certain challenges under certain conditions.  This belief sets the stage for interventions aimed at teaching lagging cognitive skills and helping kids solve the problems that are precipitating their challenging behavior. So, back to the original question:  What is the fate of the FBA?  By all means, continue doing them.  But if you want your FBA to be useful, focus on the second pass."

            question: "Is it safe to assume that you’re not too enthusiastic about zero tolerance policies?",

            question: "Is this model a good fit with Response to Intervention (RTI)?",
            answer: "There is significant congruence between the goals, structure, and practices of RTI and this model.  For the unfamiliar, recent federal legislation -- No Child Left Behind and the most recent reauthorization of the Individuals with Disabilities Act -- mandates that RTI methods be applied to practices for instructional and behavioral intervention in classrooms.  RTI represents an effort to move away from IQ-achievement discrepancies in identifying learning disabilities and permit schools to put in place intervention procedures for addressing a student’s learning needs as soon as they are identified by a classroom teacher and confirmed with supporting data.<br><br>In their book, Response to Intervention:  Principles and Strategies for Effective Practice (2005), school psychologists Rachel Brown-Chidsey and Mark Steege note that the impetus for RTI comes, at least partially, from the recognition that the needs of many students receiving services in special education could be met in general education classrooms.  As such, the first and most important school personnel to implement intervention are classroom teachers.  The model is an excellent fit with RTI in this regard.  While the model has much to offer in special education classrooms (known in RTI as Tier 3 interventions), it is perhaps even more applicable to general education classrooms.<br><br>RTI also represents an attempt to introduce scientific, data-based methods into school classrooms to guide the selection, use, and evaluation of academic and behavioral interventions.  Though it is a relatively new model, in many respects them model is a good fit along these lines as well.  The research supporting the positive outcomes achieved by the model is understandable and fully described, has been conducted in a range of settings –  families, schools, inpatient psychiatry units, and juvenile detention facilities – and is published (or in press) in peer-reviewed journals.  These studies have been conducted using both experimental (randomized) and quasi-experimental designs.  The effectiveness of the model is being independently studied in multiple settings in North America and Europe.  Among the most ambitious are a 5-year NIMH-funded study at the Virginia Tech Child Study Center, a large-scale study in the seven public schools in Sanford, Maine (funded by the Maine Juvenile Justice Advisory Group), and a large-scale project currently underway in the Newton, Massachusetts Public Schools funded by the U.S. Department of Education."

            question: "Our school system has been implementing Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports (PBIS).  It seems like there are some similarities between this model and PBIS.  Is that true?",
            answer: "There are some similarities between PBIS and Dr. Greene&#8217;s model, and also some key disparities.  PBIS relies heavily on the traditional definition of the function of challenging behavior; namely, that it’s “working” for a kid by helping the kid avoid or escape something or by helping the kid get something he wants, such as attention or peer approval.  Thus, while PBIS is open to the possibility of lagging skills as an explanation for challenging behavior, it also retains the notion that a child isn’t motivated to behave adaptively and still advocates for the use of operant (reward and punishment) strategies in such instances.  Dr. Greene&#8217;s model posits that the only way in which challenging behavior is “working” is by letting us know the kid is lacking the skills to respond adaptively to specific challenges.  Dr. Greene&#8217;s model posits that Kids do well if they can and are motivated already.<br><br>But perhaps the most striking difference between the two models is that PBIS doesn’t involve collaboration between adult and kid; it is an adult-driven model.  There is no major emphasis on trying to identify the kid’s concerns, only a major emphasis on identifying adult concerns; no emphasis on enlisting the kid in coming up with a mutually satisfactory action plan, rather, the adults come up with the action plan and provide the kid with choices; and a strong emphasis on adult management of environmental reinforcers."

            question: "How do you incorporate this model into an IEP?",
            answer: "An IEP contains a great deal of information, but perhaps the most crucial components of an IEP are the problems or lagging skills being targeted for remediation and how these problems or lagging skills are to be addressed.  If you’ve identified a kid’s lagging skills and unsolved problems (through use of the ALSUP) and established a set of priorities, you’re ready to incorporate those priorities into an IEP.  You’re also ready to document how Plan B will be used to address those lagging skills and problems."

            answer: "Try to figure out why, starting with the Empathy step.  “I’ve noticed that you haven’t been participating much in our Plan B work.  What’s up?”  They may feel they don’t have the skills to do Plan B yet. They may not be convinced about the rationale for Plan B.  They may feel completely overwhelmed.  They may be retiring soon and just don’t see the point.  We won’t really know what their concerns are unless we ask.  Then we can work toward ensuring that their concerns – and yours – are addressed."

            question: "I understand the need for parents and teachers to collaborate with each other.  But, as a teacher, what if I really can’t get the parents to work with me?",
            answer: "Keep trying to figure out why.  Keep trying to collaborate.  Bend over backwards not to blame.  Kids whose caregivers may be less able to participate in the process of helping things go well in your school may need your help more than others.  Remember that you can still do a kid a lot of good in the six hours a day, five days a week, nine months a year that he’s in school."
        }, {
            question: "How will I know if our school has “turned the corner” in our treatment of challenging kids?",
            answer: "There’s no single benchmark signifying that you’ve “arrived,” given that improvement is an ongoing process.  But there are some pretty clear indicators: The mentality toward challenging kids in your school is oriented toward lagging skills and unsolved problems, and people are actively using the ALSUP and the Plan B Flowchart in their assessment of these kids. People are skilled in and actively using Plan B. Structures supporting the use of the model are in place, including mechanisms for (1) responding to behavior problems proactively rather than emergently; (2) communicating and collaborating across staff and with parents; (3) practicing, coaching, and monitoring Plan B skills; and (4) orienting new staff to the model. Mechanisms are in place for the continuous evaluation of school discipline and discipline referrals, detentions, suspensions, and expulsions are on the decline."
